# MiniBankJS 🏦

MiniBankJS is a simple banking simulator that runs entirely in your browser.  
It’s designed as a beginner-friendly project for learning programming basics like input, validation, and state management — but with a fun "banking" theme.

## ✨ Features
- **Open Account** → create a new account with name + PIN  
- **Deposit** → add money to your account  
- **Withdraw** → take money out (with balance checks)  
- **Quit** → display a thank-you logo/message  

All data is stored in-memory (no backend, no database).  
Refreshing the page resets everything.
